# "CEH(Certified Ethical Hacker)"

---

## Introduction:
One of the most famous and practical security documents is the CEH certificate or the specialized certificate of legal hackers. The CEH certification is a security certification to assess individuals' skills in securing enterprise systems and networks and help them counter hacker attacks and intrusions. In this course, people will become familiar with hacking techniques and methods and security checklists. They will be able to check systems and networks' security status to identify and eliminate their weaknesses.<br>
The book in front of you is a translation of the official CEH book and educational slides related to this degree and some personal experiences of the authors. Efforts have been made to make the text of the book as fluent as possible so that its primary purpose, which is to convey the message, is adequately fulfilled.<br>

## Chapter 1
- ### Introduction to Legal Hacking
Most people think that hackers have high skills and knowledge that can hack computer systems and find vulnerabilities. A good hacker only needs to know how a computer system works and what tools are used to find security vulnerabilities.<br>
This chapter introduces the world of legitimate hackers. Legal hacking is a type of hacking that is done with an organizational license and to increase security.<br>

## Chapter 2
- ### Information gathering and social engineering
This chapter discusses the first part of the hacking process, which is footprinting. Footprinting is the process of gathering all the information available about an organization. This information can be used for the hacking process. Sometimes, this information is also used for social engineering.<br>
In this chapter, we will explain both hacking methods in detail.<br>

## Chapter 5
- ### Worm, Virus, Backdoor, Trojan
Trojans and backdoors are two ways hackers can enter a system, and there are many different types, but they all have one thing in common. Another program must install them, or the user must intervene to install them on the system. Trojans and backdoors are dangerous tools in a legitimate hacker toolkit that should be used to test the security of a networked system.<br>
Viruses and worms can be as dangerous as trojans and backdoors. Many viruses trigger trojans and can damage the system and then open a backdoor for the hacker. This chapter discusses the similarities and differences between Trojans, backdoors, viruses, and worms. These malicious tools and codes are essential to legitimate hackers because hackers use these tools to attack systems.<br>

#### 🔹 Topics in this chapter include
| <b>Chapter 5</b>  |   |   |

## Chapter 6
- ### Sniffers
A sniffer is a tool for obtaining packages or frames. It eavesdrops on network traffic and shows them to the hacker as a command line with graphics. Some advanced sniffer eavesdrops on packets and can put them back together to form the original text or email.<br>
Sniffer is used to capturing traffic sent between two systems. Depending on how the sniffer is used and security measures, the hacker can use the sniffer to detect usernames, passwords, and other confidential information posted on the network. Many hacking attacks and hacking tools require a sniffer to obtain important information from the target system. In this chapter, we will explain how sniffer works and some standard sniffer tools.<br>

## Chapter 7
- ### Denial of Service and Session hijacking
A hacker tries to quickly slow down the system in a DoS attack and prevent users from using its resources. Hackers can target only one method or one network, and they usually succeed.<br>
Session hijacking is one of the methods of hacking. Once the hacker has taken the session, it creates a temporary DoS for the end-user. After a user makes a regular session, the hacker uses session hijacking to capture the session. It can also use session hijacking to carry out a man-in-the-middle attack when the hacker is between the receiver and the client and eavesdrops on all traffic.<br>

## Chapter 8
- ### Hacking web servers, vulnerabilities in web applications, web-based password cracking techniques
Web servers and web applications are highly susceptible to attack. The first reason is that web servers must be accessible via the Internet. When a web server is attacked, it provides a way for a hacker to enter the network. Not only web server software but also programs running on the webserver can be used for the attack. Because of their functionality, web servers are more accessible and less protected than other systems, so it is much easier to attack web servers.<br>

## Chapter 9
- ### SQL Injection and Buffer Overflow
SQL injection and Buffer Overflow attacks are similar in that they both take place through the user's input box. A user input box is where a user may enter their username and password on a website, add data to a URL, and search for a word in an application.<br>
SQL injection and Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities are both caused by one problem: Invalid parameters. If developers do not spend enough time examining the variables that the user can enter, the results will be severe and unpredictable. Professional hackers can take advantage of these vulnerabilities and shut down the system or program or take a shell to execute their commands.<br>

## Chapter 11
- ### Physical security
Physical security is one of the most critical parts of IT security to prevent the loss or theft of confidential and sensitive data. If an organization fails to provide adequate physical security, other technical security measures such as firewalls and IDSs can be circumvented.<br>
There is a sentence that says, "When you log in, your network is yours." By physically securing your network and organization, you prevent theft of equipment such as laptops or tape drives, embedding keyloggers on systems, and placing access points on the web. Physical security depends on individuals. Therefore, it is prone to social engineering attacks, such as entering a building behind an employee and not providing an ID card or key (thus, bypassing the problem of physical security).<br>

## Chapter 12
- ### Hack Linux
Linux is a popular operating system for system administrators because it is a source and allows change. Because Linux is open-source, there are several versions of it called distribution. Some of these distributions serve as a commercial operating system for clients and servers. Some of its standard distributions are Mandrake, RedHat Debian, and SUSE; some of the free versions are Gentoo and Knoppix.<br>
The flexibility and cost of Linux, as well as the increase in the number of Linux applications, has led to the choice of Linux as the operating system of many systems. Although Linux is more secure than Windows, it has vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This chapter describes how to use Linux as an operating system and secure it to prevent an attack.<br>

## Chapter 13
- ### Avoiding IDSs, Honeypots and Firewalls
Intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, and honeypots are security measures that assure you that a hacker cannot access your network or system. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls are closed filtering devices and monitor traffic according to pre-written rules. Honeypot is a fake target system used as bait for a hacker to keep him from achieving valuable targets. As a security expert, you need to be familiar with how they work and how they create security.<br>

- ### Cryptography
Cryptography is the study of encryption and encryption algorithms. Encryption is the conversion of a message from exact text to ciphertext and vice versa. The purpose of encryption is to convert the data so that the eavesdropper can not read the data with someone who does not have the password—encryption to secure communications. Cryptography defines the techniques used in encryption. This chapter will explain cryptography and encryption algorithms.<br>

- ### Penetration testing methods
Penetration testing simulates a hacker attack to gain access to a network with an organization's systems. The purpose of penetration testing is to examine an organization's implementation and security policy: Basically, to see if the organization has adequately implemented the security criteria set out in its security policy.<br>
A hacker who intends to gain access to an organization's network is different from a person who performs as a pen tester and uses his knowledge to increase an organization's network's security without risk.<br>
